## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Orchestrator agent (`@dev-team-lead`) — auto-delegates tasks to specialists, manages adversarial review loop, resolves conflicts
- `--preset` flag for `npx dev-team init`: `backend`, `fullstack`, `data` bundles with pre-configured agent selection
- `npx dev-team create-agent <name>` command — scaffolds custom agent definition and memory template
- Custom agent authoring guide (`docs/custom-agents.md`) with format reference, blank template, memory guide, and worked example
- Configurable agent watch lists — file-pattern-to-agent mappings in `dev-team.json` with auto-spawn recommendations
- Memory freshness check in pre-commit gate — reminds to update learnings when code changes without memory updates
- 10 agents total (added Lead), 6 hooks (added watch list), 117 tests
